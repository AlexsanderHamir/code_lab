# ðŸ§ª Experiments Workspace

Welcome to my experiments workspace! This is where I explore, test, and benchmark various programming concepts, algorithms, and implementations. Each experiment has its own README with detailed documentation and results.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Experiments

1. **[Go Primitives Performance Benchmarking](golang_primitives/readme.md)** - Comprehensive benchmarking of different Go synchronization primitives for implementing object pools.
2. _[More experiments coming soon...]_
